<h1>Chef Release Cadence</h1>

<p>Chef follows <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> for releases. Major
versions (eg. 11.x -&gt; 12.x) will include backwards-incompatible changes, minor
versions (eg 12.1 -&gt; 12.2) will include new features and bug fixes but will be
backwards-compatible to the best of our ability. Patch versions are governed
by <a href="rfc047-release-process.md">RFC 47</a>.</p>

<p>Chef feature releases are promoted to the stable channel once per month. It is
expected that this occur during the second week of the month unless
circumstances intervene. Additional patch releases for a given feature release
may be promoted if critical issues are found.</p>

<p>ChefDK is released once per month. It is expected that this occur during the
fourth week of the month unless circumstances intervene.</p>

<p>Both Chef and ChefDK will prepare a release candidate before the target release
date, usually in the week before but at least three business days before release.</p>

<p>The Chef release in April of each year is a major version release, which will
contain backwards-incompatible changes. A reminder notice will be sent via
Discourse and Slack in March that will summarize the changes slated for the release.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>Monthly releases help ensure we get new features and minor bug fixes out to Chef
users in a timely fashion while not overloading the maintainer teams.
Similarly, offsetting the Chef and ChefDK releases allows the full attention of
the Chef development team on each of those releases and leaves time for any
potential hot fixes or follow-up.</p>

<p>Major releases in April avoids releasing during winter holidays, summer
vacations, ChefConf and Chef Summits.</p>
