# Hugging in the Chef Community

In order to bridge the cultural gap between the US and Worldwide community the concept of hugging should be explained.

## Motivation

    As a Chef Community Participant,
    I want to express positive emotion to or for another Chef Community Participant,
    so that we can express our friendship physically.

## Specification

When approaching another Chef Community Member that you wish to engage in a hug. In order to comply with the already
existing Chef Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct at various community events. You must seek permission from the
other community member by either verbally or physically indicating that you wish to hug them.

An example, but not limited to, of a verbal indication for permission to hug is to ask "Can I give you a hug?" or "Can we hug?"
The other party will then respond with verbal consent; for example "Yes, we can" or "Yes, you may"

An example, but not limited to, of a physical indication for permission to hug is spread your arms apart from your body. The other
party can indicate permission by repeating the same physical expression to provide consent.
