# Chef Community Guidelines

A guideline that outlines the code of conduct expected when participating in the Chef Community and the remedies available when this code is not followed.

## Motivation

The community is a mixture of professionals and volunteers who come from all over the world and work together to make Chef better, including mentoring, teaching, and connecting with other members of the community.  Diversity is one of our biggest strengths, but it can also bring increased communication challenges at times.  

Previous community guidelines have described the expected behavior but fall short of suggesting remedies when there are violations.

## Specification

The following shall become our Community Guidelines

### Community Guidelines

The community is a mixture of professionals and volunteers who come from all over the world and work together to make Chef better, including mentoring, teaching, and connecting with other members of the community.

Diversity is one of our biggest strengths, but it can also bring increased communication challenges at times.

To that end, as you are working with other members of the community, please keep in mind the following guidelines, which apply equally to founders, mentors, those who submit new features and pull requests, and to anyone who is seeking help and guidance.

The following list isn’t exhaustive; it is intended to help all of us communicate well so that the community can work better together:

* **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
* **Be considerate.**
* **Be respectful.**
* **Be professional.**
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.**
* **When we disagree, let’s all work together to understand why.**

The previous list applies to all forms of communication: IRC, the mailing list, the issue tracker, and any other forum that is used by the community. Please keep in mind that:

* Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others.
* Decisions that you make will often affect others in the community.
* Disagreements happen, but should not be an excuse for poor behavior and bad manners. When disagreements do happen, let’s work together to solve them effectively and in a way that ensures that everyone understands what the disagreement was.
* People may not understand jokes, sarcasm, and oblique references in the same way that you do. So remember that and be kind to the other members of the community.
* Sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments are not welcome in the community.

The strength of the community comes from all of the people in it, their wide range of backgrounds, and the unique contributions everyone makes. Let’s keep working together, learning from our mistakes, and making this community as awesome as it can be.
