# Chef Community Guidelines

A guideline that outlines the code of conduct expected when participating in the Chef Community and the remedies available when this code is not followed.

## Motivation

The community is a mixture of professionals and volunteers who come from all over the world and work together to make Chef better, including mentoring, teaching, and connecting with other members of the community.  Diversity is one of our biggest strengths, but it can also bring increased communication challenges at times.  

Previous community guidelines have described the expected behavior but fall short of suggesting remedies when there are violations.

## Specification

The following shall become our Community Guidelines

### Community Guidelines

#### The Short Version

Chef Software, Inc. is dedicated to a harassment-free community experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Community members violating these rules may be asked to cease participation in the community.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

#### The Longer Version

The community is a mixture of professionals and volunteers who come from all over the world and work together to make Chef better, including mentoring, teaching, and connecting with other members of the community.

Diversity is one of our biggest strengths, but it can also bring increased communication challenges at times.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. If you think your conversation is making another community member uncomfortable, try to make amends and move forward.

As you are working with other members of the community, please keep in mind the following guidelines, which apply equally to founders, mentors, those who submit new features and pull requests, and to anyone who is seeking help and guidance.

The following list isn’t exhaustive; it is intended to help all of us communicate well so that the community can work better together:

* **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
* **Be considerate.**
* **Be respectful.**
* **Be professional.**
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.**
* **When we disagree, let’s all work together to understand why.**

The previous list applies to all forms of communication: IRC, the mailing list, the issue tracker, and any other forum that is used by the community.

Please keep in mind that:

* Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others.
* Decisions that you make will often affect others in the community.
* Disagreements happen, but should not be an excuse for poor behavior and bad manners. When disagreements do happen, let’s work together to solve them effectively and in a way that ensures that everyone understands what the disagreement was.
* People may not understand jokes, sarcasm, and oblique references in the same way that you do. So remember that and be kind to the other members of the community.
* Sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments are not welcome in the community.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, persistent following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Further unacceptable behavior will result in escalating sanctions.


The strength of the community comes from all of the people in it, their wide range of backgrounds, and the unique contributions everyone makes. Let’s keep working together, learning from our mistakes, and making this community as awesome as it can be.

#### Procedure for Incident Handling

Behavior outside of our community guidelines is unacceptable and should and will not be tolerated by anyone. If you encounter such behavior, please contact a member of the Chef community team immediately.

Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a community manager. All reports are confidential. Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the staff have had sufficient time to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection as it is the other community members.

**Editorial Note**:  *Need to add something here about how to identify who should receive incident reports.  Operators in IRC channels are obvious but that implies we need to also have some training and agreement on how one becomes an operator.  Barring any other obvious choice, reports should go to the community team employed by Chef.  The contact information for that team should be kept up-to-date in this document.*

When reporting the incident, try to gather as much information as available but do not interview people about the incident. Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

* Identifying information (name, email address, IRC nick, etc.) of the person doing the harassing
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in the incident

The community management team is well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.

If you feel your safety is in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Community Guidelines are extremely damaging to the community, and they will not be tolerated. The silver lining is that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for the offenders, and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better. The Chef community team requests that they be your first resource when reporting a Chef Community-related incident, so that they may enforce the Community Guidelines and take quick action toward a resolution.

If at all possible, all reports should be made directly to [Nathen Harvey](mailto:nharvey@getchef.com), Community Director or [Mary Thengvall](mailto:mary@getchef.com), Community Manager.

#### Staff Procedure for Incident Handling

Be sure to have a good understanding of our Community Guidelines.

Also have a good understanding of what is expected from a community member that wants to report a harassment incident. These guidelines can be found in the Attendee Procedure for incident handling.

Try to get as much detail of the incident in written form from the reporter. If you cannot, transcribe it yourself as it was told to you. The important information to gather includes the following:

* Identifying information (name, email address, IRC nick, etc.) of the person doing the harassing
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior
* The approximate time the report was made
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in the incident

Prepare an initial response to the incident. This initial response is very important. Depending on the severity/details of the incident, please follow these guidelines:

* If there is any general threat to attendees or the safety of anyone is in doubt, summon security or police.
* Ask them "how can I help?"
* If the harassment occurs in a physical location such as a conference or meetup:
  * Offer the victim a private place to sit
  Ask “is there a friend or trusted person who you would like to be with you?” (if so, arrange for someone to fetch this person)
* Provide them with your list of emergency contacts if they need help later
* If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim’s request

There are also some guidelines as to what not to do as an initial response:

* Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK. This suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore coercive. “If you’re OK with it [pursuing the complaint]” suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.
* Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a staff responsibility.
* Do not offer them input into penalties. This is the staff’s responsibility.
* Once something is reported to a staff member, immediately meet with the  community director. The main objectives of this meeting is to find out the following:

* What happened?
* Are we doing anything about it?
* Who is doing those things?
* When are they doing them?

After the staff meeting and discussion, have a staff member (preferably the community director if available) communicate with the alleged harasser. Make sure to inform them of what has been reported about them.

Allow the alleged harasser to give their side of the story to the staff. After this point, if the report stands, let the alleged harasser know what actions will be taken against them.

Some things for the staff to consider when dealing with Community Guideline offenders:

* Warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions
* Requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
* Ending a talk that violates the policy early
* Not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
* Not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event now or in the future
* Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds
* Requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future events your organization runs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* Requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
* Banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* Publishing an account of the harassment and calling for the resignation of the harasser from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without formal authority: may be called for if the harasser is the event leader, or refuses to stand aside from the conflict of interest, or similar, typically event staff have sufficient governing rights over their space that this isn’t as useful)
* Give accused attendees a place to appeal to if there is one, but in the meantime the report stands. Keep in mind that it is not a good idea to encourage an apology from the harasser.

It is very important how we deal with the incident publicly. Our policy is to make sure that everyone aware of the initial incident is also made aware that it is not according to policy and that official action has been taken – while still respecting the privacy of individual attendees. When speaking to individuals (those who are aware of the incident, but were not involved with the incident) about the incident it is a good idea to keep the details out.

Depending on the incident, the community director, or designate, may decide to make one or more public statements. No one other than the community director or someone delegated authority from the community director should make any announcements. No personal information about either party will be disclosed as part of this process.

If some attendees were angered by the incident, it is best to apologize to them that the incident occurred to begin with. If there are residual hard feelings, suggest to them to write an email to the community director. It will be dealt with accordingly.

Behavior outside of our community guidelines is unacceptable and should and will not be tolerated by anyone. If you encounter such behavior, please contact a member of the Chef community team immediately.
