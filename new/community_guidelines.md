# Chef Community Guidelines

A guideline that outlines the code of conduct expected when participating in the Chef Community and the remedies available when this code is not followed.

## Motivation

As a member of the Chef community I want a set of ground rules that encourage respect and cooperation between members and provide a remediation process when there are violations so that I feel welcome and safe.

## Specification

The following shall become our Community Guidelines

### Community Guidelines

The Chef community is a mixture of professionals and volunteers who come from all over the world and work together to make Chef better. Community members fulfill many roles, including mentoring, teaching, and connecting with other members of the community.

Diversity is one of our biggest strengths, but it can also bring increased communication challenges at times.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. If you think your conversation is making another community member uncomfortable, try to make amends and move forward.

As you are working with other members of the community, please keep in mind the following guidelines, which apply equally to founders, mentors, those who submit new features and pull requests, and to anyone who is seeking help and guidance.

The following list isn’t exhaustive; it is intended to help all of us communicate well so that the community can work better together:

* **Be welcoming, inclusive, friendly, and patient.**
* **Be considerate.**
* **Be respectful.**
* **Be professional.**
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.**
* **When we disagree, let’s all work together to understand why.**

The previous list applies to all forms of communication: IRC, the mailing list, the issue tracker, and any other forum that is used by the community.

Please keep in mind that:

* Your work will be used by other people, and you, in turn, will depend on the work of others.
* Decisions that you make will often affect others in the community.
* Disagreements happen, but should not be an excuse for poor behavior and bad manners. When disagreements do happen, let’s work together to solve them effectively and in a way that ensures that everyone understands what the disagreement was.
* People may not understand jokes, sarcasm, and oblique references in the same way that you do. So remember that and be kind to the other members of the community.
* Sexist, racist, and other prejudicial or exclusionary comments are not welcome in the community.

#### Unacceptable Behavior

Harassment comes in many forms, including but not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, and sexual images.

As a community that often meets at public spaces, harassment also includes: stalking, persistent following, intrusive or otherwise unwanted photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Any physical violence or intimidation, threatened or acted on, is a serious offense.

#### Roles

* The **Decider** has final say on community guidelines and final authority on punitive actions and appeals. As per the [Chef RFC process](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc000-rfc-process.md), the top-level decider is [Adam Jacob](mailto:adam@getchef.com).
* The **Community Ombudsman** (or Champion? or Manager?) is responsible for keeping the community guidelines up-to-date, meeting regularly with community advocates, and helping enforce the community guidelines.  The Community Ombusdman is an employee of Chef Software, Inc.
* A **Community Advocates** may be assigned for each area where the community convenes (IRC, email list, GitHub, etc.).  Advocates are responsible for helping shape and enforce the community guidelines.
* A **Community Member** is anyone who participates with the community whether in-person or via online channels.

Community Advocates and the Ombudsman must be agreed on by the community while the Decider retains veto power.  Create a pull request against this document to volunteer as a community advocate for a particular area.

##### Current Roles


#### Procedure for Incident Handling

Behavior outside of our community guidelines is unacceptable and should and will not be tolerated by anyone. If you encounter such behavior, please report it immediately.

The Chef Community advocates are well informed on how to deal with incidents. Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to one of the community advocates listed below.  See the "Roles" section above for a description of each role.

* Decider
  * Adam Jacob - &lt;[adam@getchef.com](mailto:adam@getchef.com)&gt; - IRC: holoway
* Ombudsman
  * Nathen Harvey - &lt;[nharvey@getchef.com](mailto:nharvey@getchef.com)&gt; - +1 202-368-7264 - IRC: nathenharvey
* Advocates -
  * IRC - generally, individuals with operator in a channel are designated as community advocates
    * \#chef -
    * \#chef-hacking -
  * chef@ mailing list -
  * chef-dev@ mailing list -
  * GitHub -

The important information to report consists of:

* Identifying information (name, email address, IRC nick, etc.) of the person doing the harassing
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in the incident

If you feel your safety is in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Community Guidelines are extremely damaging to the community, and they will not be tolerated. The silver lining is that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for the community as a whole to grow, learn, and become better. The Chef community team requests that they be your first resource when reporting a Chef Community-related incident, so that they may enforce the Community Guidelines and take quick action toward a resolution.
