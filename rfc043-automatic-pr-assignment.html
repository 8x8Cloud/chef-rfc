<h1>Automatically manage Pull Requests</h1>

<p>We would like to automatically assign pull requests to
a suitable reviewer on submission. A reviewer would be chosen from the
group of maintainers of the project, attempting to ensure that no
reviewer becomes overloaded by Pull Requests.</p>

<p>Especially for community developers, providing fast feedback ensures
that the contributer stays engaged, rather than becoming discouraged by
a submission languishing for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>We would also like to capture metrics related to pull requests, such as
life times, conversation length, and merge/reject/abandon ratios.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Each project should expose a machine readable MAINTAINERS file, allowing
for discovery of maintainers by an automated process (&quot;bot&quot;).</p>

<p>For each new Pull Request, the bot will automatically assign a reviewer
based on the list retrieved from the maintainers file. It will attempt
to ensure that no-one has too many PRs assigned to them at any one time.</p>

<p>Any reviewer must be able to place themselves on vacation, which
would prevent the bot assigning any PRs to them.</p>

<p>A list of file paths will be associated with each component so that the
bot can correctly choose to use either a subsystem maintainer or a core
maintainer, prefering the most specific possible.</p>

<p>If the reviewer is not able to help, they can choose to ask the bot to
assign a new reviewer, or they can reassign the PR themselves.</p>

<p>Once a Pull Request is closed, the bot will record a set of metrics
related to the PR.</p>
