# Hugging in the Chef Community

In order to bridge the cultural gap between the US and Worldwide community the
concept of hugging should be explained.

## Motivation

    As a Chef Community Participant,
    I want to express positive emotion to or for another Chef Community Participant,
    so that we can express our friendship physically.

## Specification

Foremost, we want all community members to feel safe and welcome. This is
expressed in the Chef Community Guidelines ([RFC020][rfc020]) and the Code of
Conduct for our events (e.g. [ChefConf][chefconf]). When approaching another
Chef Community Member that you wish to engage in a hug, you must first seek
permission from the other community member by either verbally or physically
indicating that you wish to hug them.

An example, but not limited to, of a verbal indication for permission to hug is
to ask "Can I give you a hug?" or "Can we hug?" The other party should then
respond with verbal statement; for example "Yes, we can" or "Yes, you may."
is a positive reaction, whereas "No, Thank you." or "No, thanks" are considered
negative reactions.

An example, but not limited to, of a physical indication for permission to hug
is spread your arms apart from your body. The other party can indicate
permission by repeating the same physical expression to provide consent.

If Community member would like to express a hug, but has a limitation via
a sickness or unable to use the typical hug process they may also express via
other means, examples are but not limited to:
- fist bumps
- high fives
- in the case of an illness
  - [elbow to elbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_bump)
  - backward head nods by moving the chin upwards


A Community member may signal their desire not to participate in the hug.
Such signals may include, but are not limited to:
- walking away
- shaking ones head in a sign of "No"
- verbally expressing "No, Thank you."
- crossing your arms over your chest placing your right hand on your left
  shoulder and left hand on your right shoulder
