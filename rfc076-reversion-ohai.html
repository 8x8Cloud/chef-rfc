<h1>Change Ohai version numbers to match Chef</h1>

<p>In general, Ohai and Chef are released together, and their functionality
is interdependent. It would be much simpler to reason about how
functionality added to either would affect the other if their version
numbers were aligned.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Ohai will be renumbered to 12.x.y, where x and y are the current development
minor and patch versions of Chef. Chef would then have a equality version
pin to Ohai of &quot;= 12.x.y&quot;, and Ohai would have a similar equality
pin to ChefConfig.</p>

<p>The version bot currently used to automatically change version numbers
for Chef would also be used to update Ohai&#39;s version number when Chef is
bumped.</p>

<p>The change from 8 to 12 would not be considered a
major version bump for API impact considerations, so no deprecated
functionality would be removed.</p>

<h2>Downstream Impact</h2>

<p>Any library which version pins to Ohai &lt; 9.0 would need to be updated to
be &lt; 13.0.</p>
